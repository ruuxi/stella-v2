/**
 * Renders whichever panel-owned sidebar section is active.

 * is destroyed by an unmount, and the Apps section hosts live user apps whose
 * whole point is that they keep running. Switching tabs must not cost either
 * of them their state, and neither must closing the panel — which is why the
 * hidden host stays mounted even when `panelOpen` is false.
