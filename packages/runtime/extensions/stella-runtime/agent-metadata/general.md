`tools:` is the ceiling for a TOP-LEVEL General agent. Exposure is two-tier and
frontmatter cannot express that on its own, because one list is shared by every
General thread: a parent-owned General — one spawned BY another agent — runs
this same set MINUS the orchestration tools (spawn_agent, send_input,
pause_agent), so it cannot open a third level or steer a sibling thread. That
second tier is applied at run time from the thread's ownership, in
`AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_TOOL_NAMES` / `getToolCatalog({ parentOwned })`.
