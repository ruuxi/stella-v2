# Generating media via Stella

Stella ships a managed media gateway that fronts every supported provider. Use it instead of calling provider APIs directly.

## Still images

General does not call `image_gen` directly. The orchestrator's `image_gen` honors the image provider selected in Settings: Stella uses the managed gateway, while OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Fal use the user's locally saved provider credential directly. The call stays pending through generation and local artifact materialization, then returns terminal success, failure, cancellation, or a distinct unknown outcome. Do not poll or resubmit it. Local references sent through Stella managed generation require explicit per-call upload consent; BYOK references bypass Stella managed storage. Use the documented `stella-media` command for General-agent `exec_command` workflows.

## Video, audio, 3D — read the relevant doc page first

`web` fetch the URL for the operation you need, then call the gateway accordingly:

| Domain   | URL                                   | Operations                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overview | `https://stella.sh/docs/media`        | Request/response shape, auth contract                         |
| Images   | `https://stella.sh/docs/media/images` | `text_to_image`, `icon`, `image_edit`                         |
| Video    | `https://stella.sh/docs/media/video`  | `image_to_video`, `video_extend`, `video_to_video`            |
| Audio    | `https://stella.sh/docs/media/audio`  | `audio_generation`, `speech_to_text`, `audio_visual_separate` |
| Music    | `https://stella.sh/docs/media/music`  | `text_to_music`                                               |
| 3D       | `https://stella.sh/docs/media/3d`     | `text_to_3d`                                                  |

## Don't call provider APIs directly

Unless the task explicitly requires something the gateway doesn't support, route through the gateway. Direct provider calls bypass billing, auth, and persistence.

## 401 means the user is signed out

The 401 body has `code: "auth_required"` and an `action` string. Stop the job, surface `action` to the user verbatim via the Orchestrator, and retry once they confirm sign-in. Don't loop.
