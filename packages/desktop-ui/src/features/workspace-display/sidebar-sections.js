/**
 * The right sidebar's primary sections plus its Settings utility surface,
 * and the "where was I" memory each one keeps.
 *
 * This sits beside `tab-store` rather than inside it because the two answer
 * different questions. `tab-store` owns the *viewer registry*: which artifact
 * specs exist and how wide the panel is. This store owns the *sidebar's
 * navigation*: which section is showing, and for each section,
 * the sub-location the user last had open. Keeping them apart means a payload
 * arriving from an agent can register a viewer without deciding anything about
 * which section the user is looking at.
 *
 * Per-section memory is the whole point of the split. Selecting a section never
 * resets it: reopening Work returns to the item you had open, reopening Apps
 * returns to the running app. Only an explicit in-section back gesture
 * (`clearLocation`) returns a section to its list.
