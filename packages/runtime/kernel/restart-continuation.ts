/**
 * Restart-with-continuation: auto-resume of orchestrator/agent work after a
 * Stella self-restart (self-mod apply, dev relaunch, or any graceful quit).
 *
 * Two cooperating artifacts, both living in `stellaDataDir`:
 *
 *  1. SHUTDOWN RECORD (`restart-continuation.json`) — written by the HOST at
 *     restart initiation (worker restart, host stop / app quit). Minimal on
 *     purpose: `{ episodeId, reason, createdAt }`. The set of interrupted
 *     threads is NOT recorded here — the durable `runtime_agents` rows with
 *     status `running` at next boot are exactly the threads that were in
 *     flight at shutdown. Repeated writes within one restart episode keep
 *     the earliest (most specific) reason AND the episode id but refresh the
 *     timestamp, so staleness is measured from the actual shutdown moment.
 *     The random episode id is the identity that binds every downstream
 *     artifact to this specific restart.
 *
 *  2. INTERRUPTION STATE (`restart-interruption.json`) — written by the
 *     WORKER at boot when it consumes a fresh shutdown record AND threads
 *     were running at shutdown. Conversion is write-then-delete: the state
 *     is durably written BEFORE the record (and snapshot sidecar) are
 *     removed, and a crash between the two is deduped on the next boot via
 *     the same-episode check (matching `episodeId`), so existing delivery
 *     bookkeeping is never reset — while a DISTINCT new episode always
 *     converts, even if timestamps collide.
 *
 *  2b. SNAPSHOT SIDECAR (`restart-interrupted-threads.json`) — written by
 *     `LocalAgentManager` before a restart-related status transition: either
 *     the replacement-boot orphan sweep or v2's graceful Effect teardown.
 *     It is stamped with the episode id of the shutdown record present at
 *     that moment. The transition destroys the only live evidence of what
 *     was running, so if the interruption-state write fails on boot 1, this
 *     sidecar is what lets boot 2 genuinely reconstruct the interruption
 *     from the retained shutdown record (the live snapshot is empty by
 *     then). It is accepted as fallback evidence ONLY when its episode id
 *     matches the record's — a mismatched sidecar (e.g. retained from a
 *     failed episode N while the app kept running into a later episode
 *     N+1) is stale and is deleted instead of resurrecting old threads.
 *     Conversion consumes it on every exit path except a failed state
 *     write; the idle rule only applies when BOTH the live snapshot and
 *     the (episode-matched) sidecar are empty.
 *
 * Delivery bookkeeping is PER CONVERSATION with explicit claimed-vs-completed
 * outcomes:
 *
 *  - The boot-time synthetic turn claims a conversation (`turnClaimedAt`)
 *    immediately before dispatching its automation turn, then records
 *    `turnCompletedAt` only on a successful result (`turnFailedAt`
 *    otherwise). A claim without completion — error, hang, crash — leaves
 *    the next-user-message reminder as the PRIMARY recovery path with full
 *    resume guidance; only a completed turn earns the brief
 *    "already resumed" variant.
 *  - The reminder is delivery-safe: attaching marks it pending
 *    (`reminderAttachedAt` + the carrying run id) and it is only consumed
 *    (`reminderConsumedAt`) when that run finishes successfully
 *    (`resolveRestartReminderOutcome`). A failed/interrupted carrying turn
 *    clears the pending mark so the reminder re-attaches on the next user
 *    message.
 *
 * All file writes are atomic (tmp + fsync + rename). Persistence failures
 * fail toward re-attach/re-delivery, never toward silent loss.
 *
 * Guards: env gating, a staleness window on the shutdown record (a stale
 * record produces neither a turn nor a reminder), a 24h GC on the
 * interruption state, and the strict "idle at shutdown → nothing at all"
 * rule (no running rows at boot → no state file).
 *
 * SCOPE: graceful shutdowns only. A SIGKILL / hard crash never writes the
 * shutdown record, so no continuation fires — by design, the record is the
 * authorization that distinguishes a deliberate restart from a crash. (The
 * pre-existing orphan sweep still tidies thread rows after a crash.)
 *
 * This module must stay import-light (node:fs/path only): the host process
 * imports the record-writing half and must not pull the kernel agent stack.
