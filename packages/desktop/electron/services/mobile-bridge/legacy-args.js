/**
 * Argument-shape compatibility for phone builds that pack their own payloads.
 *
 * `window.electronAPI` on the desktop is the preload (`electron/preload.ts`);
 * on the phone it is a shim injected into the WebView. Several preload methods
 * take positional arguments but pack them into a single payload object before
 * `ipcRenderer.invoke`, and the `ipcMain.handle` handlers are written against
 * that packed shape. A shim that forwarded its arguments positionally arrived
 * as `(event, url, init)` where the handler destructured `payload.url` —
 * yielding `undefined` and, for `browser:fetchJson`, the user-visible
 * "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')".
 *
 * Current phones read the packed shape from the capability manifest, so they
 * send it correctly. This repacks for the ones that do not: phone releases ship
 * through the App Store and lag the desktop, so a desktop update alone repairs
 * already-installed phones. It is a no-op once the packed object arrives.
 *
 * The shapes come from the generated contract rather than a hand-written list,
 * so a channel added or reshaped in preload is covered without touching this
 * file.
