/**
 * Automatic wake on background command exit.
 *
 * An agent's turn is the only place its own code runs. `exec_command`
 * sessions deliberately outlive the run that started them (see the
 * teardown comment in `tools/host.ts`), so a build, benchmark, or training
 * job the agent left running keeps running after the turn ends — but
 * nothing it prints can start a new turn. The thread just stops, and the
 * work finishes into a void. That is how a GPU pod once idle-billed for
 * hours against a monitor whose output nobody read.
 *
 * So the runtime watches instead of asking the agent to. When a run ends
 * with sessions it started still alive, we attach exit watchers here. When
 * they exit, the exits are coalesced into one message and delivered to the
 * owning thread through the same `send_input` path a human or the
 * orchestrator would use — which rehydrates an evicted or finished thread
 * with its full history. The agent picks up where it left off, holding the
 * command, its exit code, and its output.
 *
 * Borrowed from Codex's session model: a "durably asleep" thread is one
 * that ended with work outstanding, and only such a thread is woken by
 * incoming mail. Here the arm IS the sleep marker — it is set at teardown
 * and replaced or dropped whenever the thread runs again, so a thread that
 * has already moved on is never woken by a stale exit.
