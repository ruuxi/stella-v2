 * Keep-alive host for user apps. Mounted once, inside the Apps sidebar
 * section — which itself is never unmounted, not even when the panel closes —
 * so an app survives switching sections, closing the panel and navigating the
 * main content area. It is deliberately *not* a child of anything keyed by the
 * open slug and never portalled: React portals preserve component state but
 * move the DOM node, which destroys iframe browsing contexts and resets
 * `<video>`/`<canvas>` and scroll. Every surface is mounted in its final home
 * and only ever hidden.
 *
 * Hidden apps sit under `visibility: hidden` + `content-visibility: hidden`,
 * so rendering work is skipped and element-visibility signals
 * (IntersectionObserver etc.) read as offscreen, while DOM state (scroll
 * positions, media elements) is preserved.
 *
 * Teardown happens through React unmount (the retained entry is dropped),
 * so app effects clean up object URLs and listeners normally.
