/**
 * Sub-agent management tools.
 *
 * Three tools manipulate the durable agent thread surface: `spawn_agent`,
 * `send_input`, and `pause_agent`. Exposure is two-tier and depends on who
 * owns the running thread, not only on its agent type:
 *
 *   - the orchestrator and a top-level (root-spawned) General agent get all
 *     three, so a General agent can run its own subagents;
 *   - a parent-owned General agent — one spawned BY another agent — gets the
 *     same toolset as a top-level General MINUS these three.
 *
 * The second tier is enforced by absence from the catalog rather than by the
 * depth-limit tool error, so a subagent cannot attempt a third level or steer
 * a sibling thread at all. See `getToolCatalog`'s `parentOwned` option.
