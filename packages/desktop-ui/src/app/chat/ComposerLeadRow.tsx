/**
 * The above-composer lead row shared by every chat composer surface (full
 * shell + sidebar/wide panel). It stacks the optional assistant reply peek
 * over the persistent activity/search pill.
 *
 * Keeping this in one place is deliberate: the row used to be duplicated in
 * the full-shell `Composer` and the sidebar `ChatPanelTab`, which is how the
 * `ComposerActivityPill` drifted onto one surface but not the other.
 * Surfaces that have no `ChatRuntimeProvider` — namely the mini window —
 * pass `showActivityPill={false}`, since the pill reads the shared runtime.
 * The full-shell pill remains mounted when the docked sidebar is visible,
 * but suppresses its running label while activity is already shown there.
