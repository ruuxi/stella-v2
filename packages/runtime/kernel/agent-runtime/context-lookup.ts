Treat those exchanges as PRIMARY evidence and reconstruct what happened from them: a user asking where to go, getting an address, then sending en-route messages means they took that trip at that time, even though no message states it outright. Later retellings are NOT evidence of absence — especially Stella\'s own earlier "I have no record of that" replies, which may be the exact failure this lookup exists to fix; when primary messages imply the event, trust them over any later claim that nothing was recorded.
