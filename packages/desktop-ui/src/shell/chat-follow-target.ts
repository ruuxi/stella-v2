/**
 * Where auto-follow parks the live tail of the chat.
 *
 * `useChatScrollManagement` owns the motion (the spring loop, the manual-scroll
 * release); this module owns the *destination* — pure arithmetic over measured
 * geometry, so the framing rules can be pinned by tests without a layout engine.
 *
 * Two things make the destination less obvious than "bottom of the streaming
 * row minus a margin":
 *
 *  1. The streaming row is not the bottom of the live tail. The working
 *     indicator is its own timeline item *below* the row, and a card row can be
 *     appended mid-turn. They occupy real space, so framing the row alone parks
 *     them under the viewport edge — visible only as a sliver, which is exactly
 *     the "indicator clipped below the fold" bug.
 *  2. The scroll viewport's bottom band is not readable. `.session-content`
 *     carries a mask that fades its last `CHAT_VIEWPORT_BOTTOM_FADE_PX` to
 *     transparent, so content sitting in that band is technically inside
 *     `clientHeight` but visually gone. Breathing space measured from the raw
 *     viewport bottom is spent on the fade before any of it reads as empty
 *     space, which is why the deliberate bottom gutter never appeared.
 *
 * Both are handled by framing `resolveLiveTailBottom()` against
 * `followBottomInsetPx()` rather than the row bottom against the raw edge.
